## üíª Current Projects
During my free I like to entertain myself with virtually anything. Study, play videogames or even build my own projects to keep growing profesionally. These are my most relevant projects so far, both coded in .NET

- ### CSharp Knowledge [![git](https://img.shields.io/badge/GIT-E44C30?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Sunther/CSharp_Knowledge):
I started this project in 2024 in order to prove myself since I was not sure what I was capable of. My intentions were to accumulate knowledge and experience but I ended up with something more. A place where I can accumulate projects with just concepts or ideas about a large variety of information and patterns that I can use afterwards. I really am happy about this Work-In-Progress.

- ### Calendar To Google:
This project aims to avoid registering all the holidays of my region on my google calendar account manually. With the help of Google API and a reliable data source. Unfortunalty, I cannot make this repository public since I am using my own accounts and personal data.

- ### QR Generator [![git](https://img.shields.io/badge/GIT-E44C30?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Sunther/QrGenerator):
This projects enables me to generate my own QR without a third party proxy webpage. It uses the NuGet package QRCoder to generate the bitmaps and then store them on disk or show them using a Maui interface.

## üìù Additional Information
- In my FDP, I had to build myself a pair of applications in Android connected by a MySQL database to assist eye doctors while checking eyesight. The main goal was to introduce relevant data during the tests and store it on a remote or local database.
Unfortunately, the university did not provide the hardware resources to finish the project and I had to improvise and virtualize everything on my laptop using VirtualBox and Genymotion

- At Vueling, there were two projects which I feel most proud of. They prove to myself that I can overcome any problems facing me (I was not asked to develop them). Those projects are:
    - A Windows Desktop Application built in .NET Framework with an interface that helps new people to adapt easier, giving them the basics that they will need to begin working. For instance, important bookmarks or applications which the program installs by itself
    - A group of Azure DevOps‚Äô pipelines that deployed and compiled Siebel avoiding a 1h of manual intervention

- Car driver licenses B (Over 3 years)
